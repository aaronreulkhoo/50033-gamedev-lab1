Unity project for Lab 3 Checkoff

### Checkoff Status
Gameplay can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x604E0x_Xkk).

Implemented everything as per the lab tutorial with a few changes:
* Combined task 1 and 4 to create a gradient shift effect for Mario. I demonstrate changing the material properties at runtime such as increasing/decreasing the frequency of the sine function (quite cool!).
* Used a single secondary camera with manually layered meshes for the parallax background (less layers and cameras to manage).
